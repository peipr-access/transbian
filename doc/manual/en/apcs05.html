<p>

Several varieties of partitioning programs have been adapted by Debian
developers to work on various types of hard disks and computer
architectures. Following is a list of the program(s) applicable for
your architecture.

</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>partman</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>

Recommended partitioning tool in Debian. This Swiss army knife can
also resize partitions, create filesystems
<span class="phrase"> (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">format</span>”</span> in Windows speak)</span>
and assign them to the mountpoints.

</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>

The original Linux disk partitioner, good for gurus.

</p>
<p>

Be careful if you have existing FreeBSD partitions on your machine.
The installation kernels include support for these partitions, but the
way that <span class="command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> represents them (or not) can make the
device names differ.  See the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-2.html" target="_top">Linux+FreeBSD HOWTO</a>.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>

A simple-to-use, full-screen disk partitioner for the rest of us.

</p>
<p>

Note that <span class="command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> doesn't understand FreeBSD
partitions at all, and, again, device names may differ as a result.

</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<p>

One of these programs will be run by default when you select
<span class="guimenuitem">Partition disks</span> (or similar). It may be possible
to use a different partitioning tool from the command line on VT2, but this
is not recommended.

</p>
<p>Remember to mark your boot partition as
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Bootable</span>”</span>.

</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm4108"></a>C.5.1. Partitioning for <span class="phrase">64-bit PC</span>
</h3></div></div></div>
<p>

If you are using a new harddisk (or want to wipe out the whole partition table
of your disk), a new partition table needs to be created. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Guided
partitioning</span>”</span> does this automatically, but when partitioning manually,
move the selection on the top-level entry of the disk and hit <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span>.
That will create a new partition table on that disk. In expert mode, you will
then be asked for the type of the partition table. Default for UEFI-based systems
is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gpt</span>”</span>, while for the older BIOS world the default value
is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">msdos</span>”</span>. In a standard priority installation those defaults
will be used automatically.

</p>
<div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>

When a partition table with type <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">gpt</span>”</span> was selected (default for
UEFI systems), a free space of 1 MB will automatically get created at the
beginning of the disk. This is intended and required to embed the GRUB2
bootloader.

</p></td></tr>

<p>

If you have an existing other operating system such as DOS or Windows and
you want to preserve that operating system while installing Debian, you may
need to resize its partition to free up space for the Debian installation.
The installer supports resizing of both FAT and NTFS filesystems; when you
get to the installer's partitioning step, select the option
<span class="guimenuitem">Manual</span> and then simply select an existing
partition and change its size.

</p>
<p>

While modern UEFI systems don't have such limitations as listed below,
the old PC BIOS generally adds additional constraints for disk
partitioning.  There is a limit to how many <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">primary</span>”</span> and
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logical</span>”</span> partitions a drive can contain.  Additionally, with pre
1994–98 BIOSes, there are limits to where on the drive the BIOS can boot
from.  More information can be found in the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/" target="_top">Linux Partition HOWTO</a>, but
this section will include a brief overview to help you plan most situations.

</p>
<p>

<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Primary</span>”</span> partitions are the original partitioning scheme for PC
disks.  However, there can only be four of them.  To get past this
limitation, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">extended</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logical</span>”</span> partitions were invented.  By
setting one of your primary partitions as an extended partition, you
can subdivide all the space allocated to that partition into logical
partitions.  You can create up to 60 logical partitions per extended
partition; however, you can only have one extended partition per
drive.

</p>
<p>

Linux limits the partitions per drive to 255 partitions for SCSI disks
(3 usable primary partitions, 252 logical partitions), and 63
partitions on an IDE drive (3 usable primary partitions, 60 logical
partitions). However the normal Debian GNU/Linux system provides
only 20 devices for partitions, so you may not install on partitions
higher than 20 unless you first manually create devices for those
partitions.

</p>
<p>

If you have a large IDE disk, and are using neither LBA addressing,
nor overlay drivers (sometimes provided by hard disk manufacturers),
then the boot partition (the partition containing your kernel image)
must be placed within the first 1024 cylinders of your hard drive
(usually around 524 megabytes, without BIOS translation).

</p>
<p>

This restriction doesn't apply if you have a BIOS newer than around
1995–98 (depending on the manufacturer) that supports the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Enhanced
Disk Drive Support Specification</span>”</span>.
Debian's Lilo alternative <span class="command"><strong>mbr</strong></span> must use the BIOS to read the
kernel from the disk into RAM.  If the BIOS int 0x13 large disk access
extensions are found to be present, they will be utilized. Otherwise,
the legacy disk access interface is used as a fall-back, and it cannot
be used to address any location on the disk higher than the 1023rd
cylinder.  Once Linux is booted, no matter what BIOS your computer
has, these restrictions no longer apply, since Linux does not use the
BIOS for disk access.

</p>
<p>

If you have a large disk, you might have to use cylinder translation
techniques, which you can set from your BIOS setup program, such as
LBA (Logical Block Addressing) or CHS translation mode (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Large</span>”</span>).
More information about issues with large disks can be found in the
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO.html" target="_top">Large Disk HOWTO</a>.  If you
are using a cylinder translation scheme, and the BIOS does not support
the large disk access extensions, then your boot partition has to fit
within the <span class="emphasis"><em>translated</em></span> representation of the
1024th cylinder.

</p>
<p>

The recommended way of accomplishing this is to create a small (25–50MB
should suffice) partition at the beginning of the disk to be used as
the boot partition, and then create whatever other partitions you wish
to have, in the remaining area.  This boot partition
<span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be mounted on <code class="filename">/boot</code>,
since that is the directory where the Linux kernel(s) will be stored.
This configuration will work on any system, regardless of whether LBA
or large disk CHS translation is used, and regardless of whether your
BIOS supports the large disk access extensions.
