<p>

A very powerful and flexible option offered by the preconfiguration tools
is the ability to run commands or scripts at certain points in the
installation.

</p>
<p>

When the filesystem of the target system is mounted, it is available in
<code class="filename">/target</code>. If an installation CD is used, when it is mounted
it is available in <code class="filename">/cdrom</code>.

</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.
#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb
# This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be
# useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state
# of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs).
#d-i partman/early_command \
#       string debconf-set partman-auto/disk "$(list-devices disk | head -n1)"
# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
#d-i preseed/late_command string apt-install zsh; in-target chsh -s /bin/zsh

<a name="preseed-seenflag"></a>B.5.2. Using preseeding to change default values</h3></div></div></div>
<p>

It is possible to use preseeding to change the default answer for a
question, but still have the question asked. To do this the
<em class="firstterm">seen</em> flag must be reset to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">false</span>”</span> after
setting the value for a question.

</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
d-i foo/bar string value
d-i foo/bar seen false
</pre></div>
<p>

The same effect can be achieved for <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> questions by
setting the parameter <code class="classname">preseed/interactive=true</code> at
the boot prompt. This can also be useful for testing or debugging your
preconfiguration file.

</p>
<p>

Note that the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">d-i</span>”</span> owner should only be used for variables
used in the installer itself. For variables belonging to packages installed
on the target system, you should use the name of that package instead. See
the footnote to <a class="xref" href="apbs02.html#preseed-bootparms" title="B.2.2. Using boot parameters to preseed questions">Section B.2.2, “Using boot parameters to preseed questions”</a>.

</p>
<p>

If you are preseeding using boot parameters, you can make the installer ask
the corresponding question by using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">?=</span>”</span> operator, i.e.
<strong class="userinput"><code><em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em>/<em class="replaceable"><code>bar</code></em>?=<em class="replaceable"><code>value</code></em></code></strong>
(or <strong class="userinput"><code><em class="replaceable"><code>owner</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>foo/bar</code></em>?=<em class="replaceable"><code>value</code></em></code></strong>).
This will of course only have effect for parameters that correspond to
questions that are actually displayed during an installation and not for
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">internal</span>”</span> parameters.

</p>
<p>

For more debugging information, use the boot parameter
<code class="classname">DEBCONF_DEBUG=5</code>.
This will cause <code class="classname">debconf</code> to print much more detail
about the current settings of each variable and about its progress through
each package's installation scripts.

<a name="preseed-chainload"></a>B.5.3. Chainloading preconfiguration files</h3></div></div></div>
<p>

It is possible to include other preconfiguration files from a preconfiguration
file. Any settings in those files will override pre-existing settings from
files loaded earlier. This makes it possible to put, for example, general
networking settings for your location in one file and more specific
settings for certain configurations in other files.

</p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
# More than one file can be listed, separated by spaces; all will be
# loaded. The included files can have preseed/include directives of their
# own as well. Note that if the filenames are relative, they are taken from
# the same directory as the preconfiguration file that includes them.
#d-i preseed/include string x.cfg

# The installer can optionally verify checksums of preconfiguration files
# before using them. Currently only md5sums are supported, list the md5sums
# in the same order as the list of files to include.
#d-i preseed/include/checksum string 5da499872becccfeda2c4872f9171c3d

# More flexibly, this runs a shell command and if it outputs the names of
# preconfiguration files, includes those files. 
#d-i preseed/include_command \
#      string if [ "`hostname`" = bob ]; then echo bob.cfg; fi

# Most flexibly of all, this downloads a program and runs it. The program
# can use commands such as debconf-set to manipulate the debconf database.
# More than one script can be listed, separated by spaces.
# Note that if the filenames are relative, they are taken from the same
# directory as the preconfiguration file that runs them.
#d-i preseed/run string foo.sh
</pre></div>
<p>

It is also possible to chainload from the initrd or file preseeding phase,
into network preseeding by setting preseed/url in the earlier files.
This will cause network preseeding to be performed when the network comes
up.  You need to be careful when doing this, since there will be two
distinct runs at preseeding, meaning for example that you get another
chance to run the preseed/early command, the second one happening after the
network comes up.
