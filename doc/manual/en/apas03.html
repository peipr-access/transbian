<p>

Once the installer starts, you will be greeted with an initial screen. Press
<span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> to boot, or read the instructions for other boot
methods and parameters (see <a class="xref" href="ch05s03.html" title="5.3. Boot Parameters">Section 5.3, “Boot Parameters”</a>).

</p>
<p>

After a while you will be asked to select your language. Use the arrow keys
to pick a language and press <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> to continue. Next you'll be asked to
select your country, with the choices including countries where your
language is spoken. If it's not on the short list, a list of all the
countries in the world is available.

</p>
<p>

You may be asked to confirm your keyboard layout. Choose the default unless
you know better.

</p>
<p>

Now sit back while debian-installer detects some of your hardware, and
loads the rest of the installation image.

</p>
<p>

Next the installer will try to detect your network hardware and set up
networking by DHCP. If you are not on a network or do not have DHCP, you
will be given the opportunity to configure the network manually.

</p>
<p>

Setting up the network is followed by the creation of user accounts. By
default you are asked to provide a password for the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">root</span>”</span>
(administrator) account and information necessary to create one regular user
account. If you do not specify a password for the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">root</span>”</span> user, this
account will be disabled but the <span class="command"><strong>sudo</strong></span> package will be installed
later to enable administrative tasks to be carried out on the new system.
By default, the first user created on the system will be allowed to use the
<span class="command"><strong>sudo</strong></span> command to become root.

</p>
<p>

The next step is setting up your clock and time zone. The installer will
try to contact a time server on the Internet to ensure the clock is set
correctly. The time zone is based on the country selected earlier and the
installer will only ask to select one if a country has multiple zones.

</p>
<p>

Now it is time to partition your disks. First you will be given the
opportunity to automatically partition either an entire drive, or available
free space on a drive (see <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#partman-auto" title="6.3.4.2. Guided Partitioning">Section 6.3.4.2, “Guided Partitioning”</a>).
This is recommended for new users or anyone in a hurry. If you do not want
to autopartition, choose <span class="guimenuitem">Manual</span> from the menu.

</p>
<p>

If you have an existing DOS or Windows partition that you want to preserve,
be very careful with automatic partitioning. If you choose manual partitioning,
you can use the installer to resize existing FAT or NTFS partitions to create
room for the Debian install: simply select the partition and specify its new size.

</p>
<p>

On the next screen you will see your partition table, how the partitions will
be formatted, and where they will be mounted. Select a partition to modify or
delete it. If you did automatic partitioning, you should just be able to choose
<span class="guimenuitem">Finish partitioning and write changes to disk</span>
from the menu to use what it set up. Remember to assign at least one partition
for swap space and to mount a partition on <code class="filename">/</code>.
For more detailed information on how to use the partitioner, please refer
to <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#di-partition" title="6.3.4. Partitioning and Mount Point Selection">Section 6.3.4, “Partitioning and Mount Point Selection”</a>; the appendix <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. Partitioning for Debian">Appendix C, <i>Partitioning for Debian</i></a> has more general information about
partitioning.

</p>
<p>

Now <code class="classname">debian-installer</code> formats your partitions and starts to install the base system,
which can take a while. That is followed by installing a kernel.

</p>
<p>

The base system that was installed earlier is a working, but very minimal
installation. To make the system more functional the next step allows you
to install additional packages by selecting tasks. Before packages can be
installed <code class="classname">apt</code> needs to be configured as that defines
from where the packages will be retrieved.
The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Standard system</span>”</span> task will be selected by default and
should normally be installed. Select the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Desktop environment</span>”</span>
task if you would like to have a graphical desktop after the installation.
See <a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#pkgsel" title="6.3.6.2. Selecting and Installing Software">Section 6.3.6.2, “Selecting and Installing Software”</a> for additional information about this step.

</p>
<p>

The last step is to install a boot loader. If the installer detects
other operating systems on your computer, it will add them to the boot menu
and let you know.
<span class="phrase">By default GRUB will be installed to the UEFI partition/boot
record of the primary drive, which is generally a good choice. You'll be
given the opportunity to override that choice and install it elsewhere.
</span>

</p>
<p>

<code class="classname">debian-installer</code> will now tell you that the installation has
finished. Remove the cdrom or other boot media and hit <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> to reboot
your machine. It should boot up into the newly installed system and
allow you to log in. This is explained in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Booting Into Your New Debian System">Chapter 7, <i>Booting Into Your New Debian System</i></a>.
